# Heath-Care-Monitoring-System
A project using Arduino and sensors to track SPO2, blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG for real-time health monitoring and analysis.
Here's a simple `README.md` file template for your Health Care Monitoring System project. You can customize it based on the specifics of your project.

## Features

- **SPO2 Monitoring:** Measures blood oxygen saturation levels.
- **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** Tracks systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
- **Heart Rate Monitoring:** Measures heart rate in beats per minute.
- **ECG Monitoring:** Captures and analyzes electrocardiogram signals.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega)
- **SPO2 Sensor** (e.g., MAX30100)
- **Blood Pressure Sensor** (e.g., BMP180 or similar)
- **Heart Rate Sensor** (e.g., Pulse Sensor)
- **ECG Sensor** (e.g., AD8232)
- **LCD Display** (optional for real-time data display)
- **Connecting Wires and Breadboard**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/manjuhallegowda/healthcare-monitoring-system.git
   ```
2. **Upload the Code to Arduino:**
   - Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
   - Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Click on the "Upload" button to flash the code to the Arduino board.

3. **Connect the Sensors:**
   - Follow the wiring diagram provided in the project files to connect the sensors to the Arduino board.

4. **Monitor Data:**
   - Use the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view real-time data.
   - Optionally, connect an LCD display for a visual representation of the data.

## Usage

1. Ensure all sensors are properly connected and powered.
2. Open the Serial Monitor or LCD display to view the health metrics.
3. Analyze the data for health insights or integrate with a health management system.
